# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Repo for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 project. This Repo contains R code, codebook, and tidy data set for the assignment.
Contents: 
README.md
CodeBook.md
run_analysis.R
tidySet.txt

The CodeBook contains a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the script to obtain the desired result expected from this course project.
The five steps followed to obtain the project are:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidySet.txt contains the output of Step 5 of this course project.
